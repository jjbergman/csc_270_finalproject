Holmes is all about the physical world. The above website offers a download of a “categorization dictionary” (https://provalisresearch.com/Download/WordNet2.zip). I looked at the data you get, and it should be possible to use it to:

1. Grab all nouns from your Holmes text,
2. Categorize them according to “animal”, “artifact”, etc.

The way the categories appear in the text files suggest that a modification of your “detangler” script would chunk them into groups.

Then it is a simple matter of mapping words-in-Holmes-citableNodes <—> noun-categories.

A story-by-story histogram of noun-categories might be interesting, as would a histogram of category-occurrences within a story (I bet the clues tend to show up in the middle and at the end).
