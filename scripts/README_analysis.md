# Analyzing *The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes*

####Objectives
This analysis.sc script does several things as a means of categorizing nouns.

- First, it creates a list of every noun in the text of Sherlock Holmes, using a noun list from the website [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/).

####Limitations
This analysis is only done for the nouns of Sherlock Holmes, as this was the of primary interest to the research project. A full analysis of the semantic type of each word in the text could prove fruitful,
some words like spoke do not work very well. Need a lemmatized version of the text. One could do this for all of the words in Sherlock Holmes very easily- I chose to focus on the nouns because that is what I was interested in.

Discussion of how you can have confidence in the results of your analysis.

A story-by-story histogram of noun-categories might be interesting, as would a histogram of category-occurrences within a story
