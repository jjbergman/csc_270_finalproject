# Analyzing *The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes*

####Objectives
This analysis.sc script does several things as a means of categorizing nouns.

- First, it creates a list of every noun in the text of Sherlock Holmes, using a noun list from the website [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/).
- 

####Limitations
This analysis is only done for the nouns of Sherlock Holmes, as this was of primary interest to the research project. A full analysis of the semantic type of each word in the text could prove fruitful and would not be difficult to do based off the materials provided- simply use the entire list from WordNet rather than just the nouns and change the headings of each of the categories to include "NOUNS." at the beginning.

some words like spoke do not work very well. Need a lemmatized version of the text. One could do this for all of the words in Sherlock Holmes very easily- I chose to focus on the nouns because that is what I was interested in.

Discussion of how you can have confidence in the results of your analysis.

A story-by-story histogram of noun-categories might be interesting, as would a histogram of category-occurrences within a story
